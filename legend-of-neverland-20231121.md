The Legend of Neverland is an open-world mmorpg with a fantasy theme. 

# Classes
There are four classes: Swordman, Ranger, Scholar, and Craftsman. I played a Swordman, which is pretty self-explanatory, and the Ranger is straightforward. The Scholar looks like a mage/healer class and the Craftsman is a gunner. Each class also has subclasses and these can provide a bit more depth to otherwise standard gameplay. You can switch classes later in the game and this provides an option to add ranged to melee characters and melee to ranged.

# Flower Fairies
This is the gacha component. Flower Fairies are combat assistants and different fairies have different abilities and have different synergies and elemental affinities. Strategies for team formation require an understanding of the specific need for a fight and how the different fairy abilities combine. 

# Story
It's the usual chosen-one type story, but it is entertaining and there is decent voice-acting. There are some dramatic moments and the story-telling is better than I expected. I haven't completed the story, but I like it.

# Gameplay
Like most mobile titles, this game offers a range from no autoplay to complete autoplay. I found that I enjoyed having the game do the actual combat but I handle movement. Responding to telegraphs from boss creatures while letting the game handle which skill to use (entirely based on cd) was fun. In fact, a few of the boss fights were challenging and I had to repeat them. It wasn't just about gear; it was about learning the fight, which is something I rarely see in mobile titles.

# The Dailies
So, there are a lot of dailies. Most of them can auto-played, but as mentioned above, some fights require a human touch. The dailies, if you do the minimum, take about 25 minutes (around level 100); they might take longer later on. If I wanted to do *all* of the dailies, that's a big chunk of time. They're important for gearing and progression, so you need to do some of them but if you're doing dailies, you're not playing the story and then the game becomes a chore. This problem isn't unique to Legend of Neverland; this is endemic in the mmorpg genre.

# PVP
There is PVP. So far, I've only seen 1v1 and it's auto-playable. I've only done it as part of dailies. Maybe it gets better later.

# Cosmetics
I'm a sucker for costumes and there are a lot of options. Too many of them either require real money or are temporory and neither of those really appeal to me. It's a shame, because the costumes I see around look great.

# Housing
There's housing with farming for materials. The housing doesn't appear to have internal decorations, so it's just an outside view. Neat, but not super-engaging.

# Final Thoughts
I enjoy playing it. It's an interesting story, the gameplay is fine, and it's casual. The game also seems populated and even that is a pretty big draw. I'd love more accessible costumes, but I won't hold my breath. I'll probably keep playing it, but I don't think it will become a "main" mobile title for me.
