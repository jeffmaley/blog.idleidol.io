Lifeskilling in Villagers and Heroes is relatively simple, but very satisfying. Here is a short video where I tend to some crops and care for livestock. One really neat bit is that the supplies for both can be bought while you are in the pens, so you don't have to do a lot of back and forth because you forgot to buy enough seeds. Also, Mad Otter Games really brought their best when creating the animal interactions. The responses of the critters is feels really warm and genuine. I mean, for pixels.
