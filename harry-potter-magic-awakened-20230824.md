I wanted to give this game a shot. I've seen the movies, but never read the books. The movies were fun and had an engaging take on magic, magic societies, and the rules that bind them. I've played for a grand total of about 20 minutes, so this is a *very* first look.

### The Good

* The game is easy to get into and you start by interacting with Hagrid and getting your invite to Hogwarts
* The characters are voice-acted and seem pretty good so far
* Combat is card-based, but it doesn't feel clunky or awkward (at least not yet)
* The art is flat and stylized, but feels appropriate for the game

### The Bad  

Nothing yet!

### The Weird
* The character designs have oddly dark knuckles. It makes them look like they've all been in fistfights.
