Title: Mobile MMOs and Rewards or Click All The Things

Application notifications are a bit of a curse for me. I *cannot* leave them ignored. They must be acknowledged and cleared. Mobile MMOs *love* to fill nearly the entire screen with notifications and so the first 10-15 minutes of playtime of one of these games is just clearing notifications. Here's how it usually goes:

1. Start game
2. Click daily login reward
3. Click event notification
4. Click event notification reward
5. Click other event notification
6. Click *other* event notification reward
<edited for sanity>
24. Click for daily gacha tickets
25. Click some other daily reward
26. Finally start playing


As much as this bothers me, I do enjoy receiving rewards, even if they're just for being semi-functional and able to click shiny things on the screen. I would prefer the number of them be less because they're usually just filler stuff and I detest those notifications that *cannot* be cleared, such as the prompt to make your first purchase. I'm buying anything, I'm not gonna buy anything, so stop pestering me.

Keep the rewards coming, though. I like those.
