Lineage 2M is one of the two mobile variants of NCSoft's famed Lineage 2. The one is Lineage2 Revolution. Revolution is considered to be broader and shallower with heavier use of auto-play. Given how much auto-play 2M has, I'm not sure how much more could be added. Maybe the game buys its own boosts in Revolution?

For this review, I'm diving back into a character I'd created some time ago.

### Gameplay
Leveling so far seems pretty standard, with cities and towns acting as quest hubs and the quests being the usual fetch type. Lots of auto-path and auto-combat, although that can be disabled. The actual combat animation is rather nice, so if you do auto-combat it's still entertaining to watch, for a little while, anyway.

### Classes
I don't remember what class my character has and it looks like I can maybe change classes later on? In any case, he dual-wields one-handed swords, so that's neat. I can't speak to class disinction yet, but any game that has dual-wielding can't be too bad.

### World
The world-building is still basically Lineage2, love it or hate it. I never played it much, but it seems to be much like any other game: believeable as far as it goes.

### Story
At this point, I'm apparently on the tracks of some evil necromancer, but I don't know much more than that. The story feels week, to be honest.

### Other Stuff
This game has all the usual mobile cruft: Prompts to buy boosts and consumables, a variaty of time-limited events designed to make you feel pressured to participate, and plenty of low-value items to claim just for logging in.

### So, is it good?
I don't know, at least not yet. MMOs thrive on social activity and without that, there is no reason to play. The general chat seems pretty dead, but it's possible that most of the socializing is done in clan chats. I'll have to join one and report back. The gameplay is inoffensive, but nothing interesting, as is the world and story.

### Should I play it?
I also don't know. Given the game's PC version, I'm guessing that PvP is the big draw and I haven't tried that yet. I'm also not anywhere close to max level, so I can't speak to end-game. The leveling process isn't super engaging, so I wouldn't recommend based on that, but I'm curious about end game.
