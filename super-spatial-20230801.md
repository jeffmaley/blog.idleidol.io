Super Spatial (formerly Dazzle.Rocks) is a cute lifesim. Aside from the crafting and housing, you can also create and participate in "party islands". These islands have player-created games (eg: mazes) and you compete to complete them. The game is cute and fun and a great way to spend some idle time. On mobile, it plays in portrait mode, which I love. Landscape mode is great for action games, but I like the ease of portrait mode for games that require less intense reaction. I've been following the game's development, although I've just scratched the surface of the game itself. See below for a short video with simple gathering and crafting.
