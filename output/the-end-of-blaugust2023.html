<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I've tried, and failed, at blogging so many times, but this time seems different. I've found a topic I'm interested in and one that brings me joy to deep-dive in and explore. I'm focusing less on putting out the One True Post and more on consistency. Just keep writing. Obviously I didn't manage it every day, but I'm happy with every other day. In truth, I see this blog as updating once or twice per week. I'd like to spend more time developing quality posts (but <em>not</em> perfect) then quick little micro-blogs. </p>
<p>What's in the future?</p>
<p>Well, more of this. I'll keep playing existing and trying new mobile mmos. It's a fantastic space full of some of the most garbage games ever made, but also some real gems with heart and depth. </p>
<p>Play on!</p>
