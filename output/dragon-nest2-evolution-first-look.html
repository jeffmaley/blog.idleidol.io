</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Dragon Nest2 Evolution is a new mobile MMO from Level Infinite. Its relation to the original Dragon Nest game seems a bit tenous, but it is set in the same world. </p>
<p>The Good:</p>
<ul>
<li>The controls are standard touchscreen types, but they feel responsive</li>
<li>The game looks good. It's certainly stylized and a bit cartoony, but it seems quite appropriate</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bad:
* The localization is not great and many voice lines, both system and NPC, are not in English</p>
<ul>
<li>Gender-locked classes</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ok:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing new in terms of gameplay.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dragon Nest2 Evolution is <em>ok</em>. It doesn't do anything new or innovative, but it doesn't do anything badly, either. The story, as near as I could make it, is the standard "save the world from dark forces" trope. I, honestly, enjoy the trope, but it's a new take or anything. All that said, the game is still fun to play and I will keep on exploring. Maybe I will find something new or different that really makes it stand out. Check out the video below for a what a quick solo dungeon run looks like.</p>
