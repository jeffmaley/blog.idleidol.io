</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I first played Villagers and Heroes years ago and loved it. It was (relatively) simple and fun with a bit of an non-serious attitude that was engaging. For those who haven't played it, you are a hero that needs to protect the kingdom from nefarious forces. You are also a villager, where you can ply your lifeskills to the betterment of your village. More on that later.</p>
<p>The basic gameplay is quest-based and the standard fetch or kill quests are prevalent. The combat is straightforward, with a small selection of skills to augment the player's auto-attack. Each class has different specialties that change combat in small ways. For example, I am playing a Wizard specializing in Frost. In addition to cold damage, my character can slow and freeze enemies and create an ice shield to reduce incoming damage.</p>
<p>The main quest and storyline are fine, but the village part is what makes this game different. A village is an instanced collection of houses. They can be created by anyone and you can join any village that has room. The layouts are all the same. Within a given village, different upgrades can be acquired by the residents donating resources acquired via gathering. Upgrades include better crafting stations and gathering nodes. Your house in a village can have crops and livestock and, with a recent update, decorations inside.</p>
<p>You can 'rebirth' your hero, which allows you to restart the game with the same character, but includes a bonus on experience gains and talents. </p>
<p>This game has no auto-play, which is unusual for a mobile game, but very welcome. It supports cross-play, although my personal experience shows the Android client being better-performing than the PC client.</p>
