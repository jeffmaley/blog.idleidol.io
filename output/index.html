</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>TeeTINY Online:SmartTowerLife, by TEENY.studio, is a newer MMORPG available for Android and iOS. I pulled this down because the art style looked good and it was a studio that I'd never heard of. Read on for a First Look.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Character Creation
This is pretty standard. There aren't a lot of options and no sliders, but it's what I'd expect from a game like this. You don't pick a class, just a body and a name. This game wants to really focus on a community, so you only get one character.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classes
Class is determined by your weapon and they've got the standard four (warrior, mage, cleric, ranger). Nothing really special, but the starter weapons are amusing. The mage has a flower as a wand/staff and the cleric has a chunk of wood that he throws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combat
Lots of auto, but you can take manual control. The combat is on par for other mobile titles. Nothing really stands out yet, either good or bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The World
This, certainly, is where the devs are trying to make the game shine. It seems to borrow some elements from SAO in that you're constantly trying to progress through dungeon/world levels to find the Big Bad, although that Big Bad hasn't really been defined clearly yet. The level you start on is a bunch of disconnected islands that you sort of get thrown between. It's interesting and fun and I want to see more, to be honest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wrapping Up
So far, while the game doesn't appear to offer much beyond what other titles have, it has packaged it in a desirable fashion. The art style is cute, the world seems like it will be fun to explore, there's a big of irreverence, and nothing really feels off. One exception to that is the dubious localization, but that's, also, kind of on brand for mobile mmos.</p>
