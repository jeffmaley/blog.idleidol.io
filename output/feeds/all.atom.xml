I pulled this down because the art style looked good and it was a studio that I'd never heard of. Read on for a First Look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Character Creation
This is pretty standard. There aren't a lot of options and no sliders, but it's what I'd expect from a game like this. You don't pick a class, just a body and a name. This game wants to really focus on a community, so you only get one character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classes
Class is determined by your weapon and they've got the standard four (warrior, mage, cleric, ranger). Nothing really special, but the starter weapons are amusing. The mage has a flower as a wand/staff and the cleric has a chunk of wood that he throws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combat
Lots of auto, but you can take manual control. The combat is on par for other mobile titles. Nothing really stands out yet, either good or bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World
This, certainly, is where the devs are trying to make the game shine. It seems to borrow some elements from SAO in that you're constantly trying to progress through dungeon/world levels to find the Big Bad, although that Big Bad hasn't really been defined clearly yet. The level you start on is a bunch of disconnected islands that you sort of get thrown between. It's interesting and fun and I want to see more, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrapping Up
So far, while the game doesn't appear to offer much beyond what other titles have, it has packaged it in a desirable fashion. The art style is cute, the world seems like it will be fun to explore, there's a big of irreverence, and nothing really feels off. One exception to that is the dubious localization, but that's, also, kind of on brand for mobile mmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

The aesthetic was interesting, the combat was fun, and the gathering and crafting were epic. I dropped it at some point for other games, but I often thought about coming back. When they relaunched over the fall of 2024 with their semi-updated version, I came back and I've been having a blast since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubbed "Aeturnum", the relaunch purports to lean into the ARPG side more, but I can't say that I've really experienced that. It feels largely like the original game, although the leveling seems significantly faster. I really like the character creation with its suggestion of weapon combos to achieve a class. While still classless and allowing you to equip any weapon combo, the suggestions are a great starting point. I went with greatsword and blunderbuss. The greatsword I knew would be fun (I'd really enjoyed it in Throne and Liberty), but I was mixed on the blunderbuss. After playing quite, I rather like the blunderbuss. You can snipe (sort of; the distance isn't far, but it's scoped) and launch an explosive. It's a fun weapon to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combat is much the same. I'm wearing heavy armor, so I can take a lot of abuse. I tend to use blocking more than dodging. Swinging the big sword is very gratifying and I really enjoy walloping enemies with it. I feel powerful when using the greatsword, which is what I was looking for. I do miss gap-closers, but I've not run into that many action-combat MMOs that support them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the combat is fun, the real fun (for me) is in the gathering and crafting. Mining, harvesting, chopping down trees, and other gathing is super satisfying and engaging. It's honestly hard to skip a harvestable node; I sometimes have to remind myself that I have other tasks to complete. Crafting is likewise enjoyable. There are tons of recipes and you can create furniture and other housing items in addition to the usual weapons and armor. It doesn't have the whimsy of Gnomish Engineering from WoW, but you can create and play musical instruments, which is very cool. In fact, my character is level 52 and I'm not very far in the main story quest because I'm doing so much gathering/crafting and side quests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is where New World is weakest. The Aeturnum update helped considerably by adding some simple cutscenes to explain the lore and background story, but it doesn't have the grandiose, "Save the World!" feeling as games like WoW or FFXIV. On the other hand, being smaller and tighter makes the game feel more accessible, in a way. You're not trying to save the world; you're trying to figure out how to prevent an island from being swallowed by darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housing is important to me and I like how New World does it. The houses are instanced, but accessed from the town. It still sort of feels like a neighborhood in the sense that you go into your house from the street, but it is instanced and isolated. There are several layouts, with some including a second story and a garden. There are plenty of items to decorate with, including a number of seasonal items and pets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I think New World Aeturnum is the best MMO out there right now? No, it's but it's the best choice for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. I am really enjoying it. I'm not rushing; I'm taking my time and getting into the depths of the journey. I don't know much about end game, but end game for me will be about crafting, so I think I'll have plenty to do. See you in Aeturnum!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Journeys"></category></entry><entry><title>New World vs World of Warcraft</title><link href="/new-world-vs-world-of-warcraft.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-12-23T15:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-23T15:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2024-12-23:/new-world-vs-world-of-warcraft.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've started playing New World and WoW lately and thought I'd discuss why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WoW is in the middle of its 20th anniversery event. That's initially what drew me back. I only started playing in 2009 or so, during WotLK, but I've played it on and off since. I've never been much for raiding, although I did enjoy it a bit in both WotLK and Legion. Same for Mythics. I've done them, but they're not my cup of tea. I like collecting things and achievements and leveling alts. WoW is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; alt-friendly so it suits me well in that regard. I love the class distinction in WoW and how classes are more than just a collection of different attacks, but also have unique abilities that aren't combat. Mages have teleports and warlocks have water-breathing. They're fun and neat and really give a specific "feel" to a given class. Combat itself is also enjoyable, with different classes having pretty unique styles and flows, whether it's the cooldown-watching of a Death Knight or the famous three-button rotation of an Arcane Mage. The lore is in-depth with dozens and dozens of books exploring every facet of Azeroth's history, including some really neat takes on creation.
The cartoony-ness can be a turn off, but I find it charming. The usual complaints are about subscription costs and monetization, poor balance, and unimagintive content. There's some truth to those complaints, but as a casual player I've never had any issues. I'm not saying everyone should like WoW; I'm saying that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; like WoW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;New World&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New World is a polar opposite of WoW in that it has action combat and more realistic graphics. It certainly isn't as lore-rich as WoW, but it also doesn't have decades of Warcraft lore to draw from. The story in New World is interesting and very different in setting, even if the over-arching themese are similar. The aesthetic of New World is one of the more compelling aspects as I've not seen it in another MMO. Instead of traditional fantasy elements, the vibe is, well, New World, as in what people and places looked like during the settling of the US by European colonists. This really makes the game stand out from others, although if you're not a big fan of that atmosphere, there aren't really any options to change it. All the looks, even in the store, adhere to the same feel.
New World is classless and abilities are tied to the equipped weapon. Classless mmos aren't new and New World does it very similarly to others (eg: Elder Scrolls Online), but it doesn't have a traditional mage or priest class. There are magic staves and magic gloves that provide mage- and priest-like abilities, but they play very differently. Melee classes are what you'd expect. One odd omission is that there is no dual-wielding. I would love to see Amazon Game Studios add dual-wielding in the future.
Crafting and housing are another area where New World is in sharp contrast to WoW. A given character can do every gathering and crafting profession. The gathering is much more satisfying in New World; you can chop down trees and they actually fall. Housing is instanced, but the instances are entered from the city in which the house exists, so there's still a bit of a local neighborhood feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both games are fun to play and engaging with plenty of activities. It's nice to have another game to switch to when I get burnt out on one, especially since they're so different.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Ragnarok Origins Global - a Review</title><link href="/ragnarok-origins-global-a-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-03-13T20:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-03-13T20:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2024-03-13:/ragnarok-origins-global-a-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ragnarok Online has had many incarnations over the years, with several of them on mobile. Ragnarok Origins was published by Gravity Games, but shut down in late 2023. They stated that wanted a global version and that somehow required them to shutdown the existing game, which makes sense, but they oddly couldn't transfer characters, which is weird. In any case, the new version is Ragnarok Origins Global. It's the same game, as far as I can tell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Classes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ragnarok Origins Global (ROO) boasts the same classes as its predessor, including Swordsman, Acolyte, Mage, Apprentice, Thief, and Merchant. These have subclasses as you progress and while the build variety isn't huge, they're still enjoyable enough to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Character Creation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's not much to it, to be honest. There's some variety but, the game is stylized and cartoony and that limits the creativity allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gameplay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROO is quest-heavy with plenty of systems that have their own sidequests. Yes, there are dailies. A lot of the game can be autoplayed, but several of the dailies cannot, which is refreshing. Combat is basic, but ROO keeps true to its lineage with damage number display. Attacks &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; impactful because of the big numbers. The game throws health and mana potions at you and provides a device to automatically use them, so as long as you're not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; ambitious, it's easy to survive. That said, it is possible to bite off more than you can chew, so death certainly happens. There is auto-pathing and plenty of fast travel (Kafra Service), so it's simple to hop between cities and other locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Gacha&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a mobile title, so of course there's gacha. This is primarily in the form of pets. The pets are both collectible and assistants in battle. I'm not sure how much they really help, but they're often cute, so who cares. I'm just glad they're not all waifus. Some of them are, but it's almost a requirement at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROO, like other Ragnarok titles, is set in a realm heavily influenced by Norse Mythology. The world is Midgard and you're The Chosen One^TM^. The story itself starts off with a bit mystery and is rather engaging. It might not be innovative, but that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game appeals to me. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but has a lot of heart and it's cute. I can spend a surprising amount of time in the game without realizing and that's pretty amazing for a mobile title. Sure, the monetization is everywhere, but it's also easy enough to tune out and just experience the journey. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Reviews"></category></entry><entry><title>The Legend of Neverland - A Review</title><link href="/the-legend-of-neverland-a-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-12-14T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-14T10:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-12-14:/the-legend-of-neverland-a-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Legend of Neverland is an open-world mmorpg with a fantasy theme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Classes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four classes: Swordman, Ranger, Scholar, and Craftsman. I played a Swordman, which is pretty self-explanatory, and the Ranger is straightforward. The Scholar looks like a mage/healer class and the Craftsman is a gunner. Each class also has subclasses and these can provide a bit more depth to otherwise standard gameplay. You can switch classes later in the game and this provides an option to add ranged to melee characters and melee to ranged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Flower Fairies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the gacha component. Flower Fairies are combat assistants and different fairies have different abilities and have different synergies and elemental affinities. Strategies for team formation require an understanding of the specific need for a fight and how the different fairy abilities combine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Story&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the usual chosen-one type story, but it is entertaining and there is decent voice-acting. There are some dramatic moments and the story-telling is better than I expected. I haven't completed the story, but I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Gameplay&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most mobile titles, this game offers a range from no autoplay to complete autoplay. I found that I enjoyed having the game do the actual combat but I handle movement. Responding to telegraphs from boss creatures while letting the game handle which skill to use (entirely based on cd) was fun. In fact, a few of the boss fights were challenging and I had to repeat them. It wasn't just about gear; it was about learning the fight, which is something I rarely see in mobile titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Dailies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there are a lot of dailies. Most of them can auto-played, but as mentioned above, some fights require a human touch. The dailies, if you do the minimum, take about 25 minutes (around level 100); they might take longer later on. If I wanted to do &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the dailies, that's a big chunk of time. They're important for gearing and progression, so you need to do some of them but if you're doing dailies, you're not playing the story and then the game becomes a chore. This problem isn't unique to Legend of Neverland; this is endemic in the mmorpg genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;PVP&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is PVP. So far, I've only seen 1v1 and it's auto-playable. I've only done it as part of dailies. Maybe it gets better later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Cosmetics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a sucker for costumes and there are a lot of options. Too many of them either require real money or are temporory and neither of those really appeal to me. It's a shame, because the costumes I see around look great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Housing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's housing with farming for materials. The housing doesn't appear to have internal decorations, so it's just an outside view. Neat, but not super-engaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy playing it. It's an interesting story, the gameplay is fine, and it's casual. The game also seems populated and even that is a pretty big draw. I'd love more accessible costumes, but I won't hold my breath. I'll probably keep playing it, but I don't think it will become a "main" mobile title for me. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Reviews"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine W Perfect Wonderland - Review</title><link href="/divine-w-perfect-wonderland-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-10-31T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-10-31T10:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-10-31:/divine-w-perfect-wonderland-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Divine W Perfect Wonderland is an open-world mmorpg from Leniu Games.

It is set in a world of Chinese mythology and features a variety of classes. Honestly, I could probably copy and paste the review from Immortal Sword: Return and it would be pretty accurate. There are some class differences: Divine W has more of them and there's no Demon kid class, although there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a dark magic user. There is a heavy amount of auto-play and levels are handed out like candy. I was level 40 after less than 15 minutes of 'playing'. So the question is: Is it fun? For me, yes, yes it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game has fantastic graphics and a rich world full of whimsy (you get a pig companion early on). The characters have great costumes, including wings (I'm a sucker for wings). The story is, honestly, a bit hard to follow, but you might be the partial reincarnation of the 'Great Sage'. This same idea was also in Immortal Sword: Return. Wikipedia (and other sources) suggest that this was another name for Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, a well-known staple of mythology. Why is this important? Because the story of this game ties into some really interesting mythology and a good story (and the accompanying lore) can make a game much more immersive and fun, even if you're mostly reading (and digesting) quest text while the game sort of plays itself. As always, I can take over and manually move and fight and for some boss fights, it's worth doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, should &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; play this game? If you like Chinese mythology, rough-around-the-edges localization, and a very casual gaming experience, absolutely. If none of those appeal to you, the game will not be fun.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Reviews"></category></entry><entry><title>Immortal Sword: Return - A Review</title><link href="/immortal-sword-return-a-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-09-25T18:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-09-25T18:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-09-25:/immortal-sword-return-a-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Immortal Sword: Return is an open-world MMORPG from Jamland International Limited.

&lt;h2&gt;Character Creation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are five character archetypes: Fogbow (swordsman), Luna (swordswoman), Rosy (mage), Nightmare (demon), and Bodhi (monk). Customization is limited, but the characters do feel like they have their own identity in terms of abilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intro Area&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start the game looking for a way to revive your dead companion. This is usually where abilities get taught, but this game relies &lt;em&gt;heavily&lt;/em&gt; on auto-play. The intro area does introduce the story, but the localization made it tough for me to figure out what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gameplay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, you watch your character do stuff. You could take over and play it yourself, but nothing seems really challenging and even the boss fights are over in seconds. My character is level 47; maybe it gets harder later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I have no idea. You end up interacting with various immortals and I think you're supposed to be on the path to becoming an immortal, but it was tough to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been on a quest to find an enjoyable Wuxia game and while this isn't it, it was not necessarily a bad game. I did enjoy following along and trying to figure out the story while the game played itself. There was a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of dialog and that tells me there is some story and lore here even if I was having trouble following it. The character I picked was Nightmare, a little demon kid and I really loved that concept. A kid who turns into a demon for fights; what's not to love about that? It may not be a game for me, but if you like Wuxia and don't mind a rather passive role in your mobile gaming, this title might be worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Reviews"></category></entry><entry><title>Aura Kingdom 2 Evolution</title><link href="/aura-kingdom-2-evolution.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-09-07T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-09-07T10:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-09-07:/aura-kingdom-2-evolution.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Aura Kingdom 2 for mobile has been relaunched as Aura Kingdom 2 Evolution (not with NFTs) by X-Legend.

&lt;h2&gt;Character Creation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four classes:
* Shinobi (dual swords)
* Dragoon (halberd)
* Elementalist (staff and magic)
* Nymph (bow and magic)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the Nymph is gender-locked as female; the others can be male or female. Customization options are limited, but not terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intro Area&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with many mobile titles, you start the game in battle as you're taught the controls. It's simple and effective, although not terribly memorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gameplay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game offers full autoplay, but you can take control and do it all manually. I personally like the auto-pathing, but prefer to do the combat myself. The full-auto is nice for daily tasks that quickly become chores. The combat itself is similar to other titles: there are a handful of skills and a basic attack. The cooldown for the basic attack makes it not terribly useful, as one of the skills will have reset by then. The fights are relatively trivial, at least up through level 26. Oh, yeah, the leveling is gratuitous; I played for maybe an hour and reached level 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Builds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've only scratched the surface really, but there are some decisions to be made on which skills you level up. You can't level them all every time, so you want to pick the ones that you like. I would imagine they're all perfectly viable, but if the end game is competitive your choices might matter more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eidolons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the gacha companions. You have one with you during normal questing and some dungeons will involve a squad of them. They have their own skills and can be leveled up and evolved. You also have an 'affinity' score for each, which you can increase by interacting with them. The interactions so far involved being quizzed by the Eidolon on details about the game or the world and if answer correctly, the affinity score goes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NFTs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this game has NFTs. I guess. I haven't actually seen any and there aren't any in-game mentions of it, at least not so far. I'm not personally bothered by NFTs. I think they're silly, but they're also just another feature and one that I'm comfortable ignoring. Just playing a game with NFTs doesn't turn one into a crypto-bro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit confusing as the localization isn't great. It's a standard chosen-one type thing and you have to collect pieces of something to restore balance or something. It's not impactful, which is a shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a run-of-the-mill mobile game by X-Legend. If you like other X-Legend titles, which I do, this game will provide some enjoyment. If you require in-depth stories and gameplay, this game is probably not for you. In comparison to Dragon Nest 2 Evolution, the combat in Aura Kingdom 2 Evolution is easier and the gameplay is less instanced.  If you like games that are a bit goofy and irreverent, it's worth checking out. Look at my character riding a sheep:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've tried, and failed, at blogging so many times, but this time seems different. I've found a topic I'm interested in and one that brings me joy to deep-dive in and explore. I'm focusing less on putting out the One True Post and more on consistency. Just keep writing. Obviously I didn't manage it every day, but I'm happy with every other day. In truth, I see this blog as updating once or twice per week. I'd like to spend more time developing quality posts (but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; perfect) then quick little micro-blogs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, more of this. I'll keep playing existing and trying new mobile mmos. It's a fantastic space full of some of the most garbage games ever made, but also some real gems with heart and depth. &lt;/p&gt;

I've played for a grand total of about 20 minutes, so this is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; first look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game is easy to get into and you start by interacting with Hagrid and getting your invite to Hogwarts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The characters are voice-acted and seem pretty good so far&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combat is card-based, but it doesn't feel clunky or awkward (at least not yet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The art is flat and stylized, but feels appropriate for the game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Bad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing yet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Weird&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The character designs have oddly dark knuckles. It makes them look like they've all been in fistfights.&lt;/li&gt;

In fact, I've tried to start one several times and each time I lose interest or life gets busy or I question whether or not I'm offering anything of value and I stop. When I saw the posts about #Blaugust an massivelyop.com, I decided to try again. This time it would be different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it has been. Sort of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The #Blaugust committment was one post per day. I'm not really doing that, but I figured that any number of posts for the month was better than none. I had a topic that I was really interested and passionate about. All I had to do was write. Easy, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yes, but actually, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like writing, but the writing I do for work is all dry and technical. Writing for myself, with own voice, has turned out to be much harder. Looking at what I've posted, I have had a lot of short posts, posts that could have been mastodon toots, to be honest. That's not what I wanted. I &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; lengthy, well-written and designed posts that really communicated my thoughts. Instead, I've done a lot of what is essentially shouting at people on the sidewalk while driving by at 60mph. The mental effort and creative load required for good posts is ....well, it's hard. So have I failed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short answer: no&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long answer: noooooooo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blaugust isn't over and even when it is, I intend to keep this blog up. I probably won't post every day, but I will keep posting and learning to flex my creative writing muscles. It's new, it's different, but I like it and I want to do more of it. Maybe no one reads it, maybe one person reads it. Who knows. I'm going to enjoy putting my thoughts down about a topic that's important to me and that's all that matters.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Everyone Gets a Cozy Lifesim</title><link href="/everyone-gets-a-cozy-lifesim.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-17T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-17T10:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-08-17:/everyone-gets-a-cozy-lifesim.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The recent explosion of released and announced cozy lifesim games has been fun to watch.

I am enjoying Palia (to some degree) and games like Loftia look like they have potential. The classics, like Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon, while single-player, are still charming. Obviously a big shout-out to Animal Crossing: New Horizon is in order. Not entirely single-player and with an unusual sort of multi-player, it seems to be the inspiration for the recent boom. But why, though?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Life is hard sometimes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it's work or school or raising a family or all three, life is hard. It's quite reasonable to want a simpler life with no drama and no stress where you can feel good about yourself because you're &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; things. Cozy lifesims give that feeling of accomplishment through crafting and exploration and NPC relationship building. They're also &lt;em&gt;safe&lt;/em&gt;. No one is really going to get mad at you or cause a bunch of personal drama. In the online games, that may be less true, but the games are still a fantastic escape to simpler times that mostly only exist in Disney Movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ok, but which one is the best?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That largely depends on the style and gameplay you like, but given that this blog is called Mobile MMO Addict, I'm going to suggest an MMO and one that might surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Villagers and Heroes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear me out. In V&amp;amp;H, you have a house that you can decorate, crops you can grow, and livestock you can raise and gain materials from. There is plenty of crafting, including making furniture for your house. There are mounts and pets and, most importantly, &lt;em&gt;villages&lt;/em&gt;. One thing Palia doesn't seem to have is an ability to contribute to the growth of the town (maybe it's unlocked later; I haven't gotten very far). Games like AC:NH have you unlocking items for your island, but that does hit a ceiling. In Villagers and Heroes, the villages are player-created. They do all have the same map, but you can join any village that has space and all the villagers can contribute to the growth of the village and the unlocking of features (mostly through the donation of crafting materials). This simple mechanic enhances the cozy lifesim feel in a way that Palia doesn't. In Palia, I'm a resident, but I live in an instanced plot and my only interaction with the town is relationships and buying stuff. In V&amp;amp;H, I'm &lt;em&gt;invested&lt;/em&gt; in the village because my donated materials help grow it. It's a much different level of personal involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a note to future cozy lifesim MMO devs, consider how V&amp;amp;H provides a great mechanism for players to build their own communities. It's a killer feature that we need more of.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Mobile MMOs and Rewards or Click All The Things</title><link href="/mobile-mmos-and-rewards-or-click-all-the-things.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-15T11:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-15T11:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-08-15:/mobile-mmos-and-rewards-or-click-all-the-things.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Application notifications are a bit of a curse for me.

&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;edited for sanity&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click for daily gacha tickets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click some other daily reward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally start playing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as this bothers me, I do enjoy receiving rewards, even if they're just for being semi-functional and able to click shiny things on the screen. I would prefer the number of them be less because they're usually just filler stuff and I detest those notifications that &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; be cleared, such as the prompt to make your first purchase. I'm buying anything, I'm not gonna buy anything, so stop pestering me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep the rewards coming, though.

&lt;p&gt;I've reached level 16 in Dragon Nest2 and while I will probably play it on and off, I feel that I've played it enough to get a sense for the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've reached level 16 in Dragon Nest2 and while I will probably play it on and off, I feel that I've played it enough to get a sense for the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is a little confusing, but you're tasked with figuring out the purpose and/or recharding a Sage Stone. This somehow plays into defeating Elena, who appears to be a powerful sorceress. There's likely more to the story that unfolds, but it's very much a standard "Chosen hero defeats the Big Bad". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quests are fetch quests or kill X mobs, at least in the overworld game. Much of the actual gameplay involves instanced dungeons. In those, the quest is just to complete the dungeon. The text localization is ok, but all the voice-acting is non-English. Although simple, the developers did try to insert some emotional content and you end up witnessing the death of an NPC that you couldn't save. That's a nice tough, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gameplay&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combat is the big focus here. While the game has autopathing, it does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have autocombat. The combat is pretty standard, but the need for the basic attack is largely absent as there are plenty of skills with cooldowns that don't overlap. I was using a basic attack only occasionally. In dungeons, this is important because they're timed and you're not making the most efficient use of your abilities, you will run out of time and have to re-run it. There is a dogdge mechanic, but as of level 16 most damage can be tanked. There are some crowd-control effects from some bosses, but even those weren't a big driver for dodge. What &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a driver was an optional passive that increased movement and damage after a successful dodge, at least as a warrior. Area of effect damage is ideal and the warrior has some abilities for this, but getting the mobs to group up was a bit of a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general flow was autopath from one quest-giver to the next, auto-path to the dungeon, clear the dungeon, and rinse and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are upgrade systems in terms of Dragon Runes for the character and their skills and Dragon Jewels for gear. The jewels are the same mechanic as in every other game, but it looks like the Dragon Runes are a bit different. A given rune will boost certain types of damage (like light and water, or darkness and fire), but you can slot multiple runes in a Tetris-like configuration. That is something I haven't seen before and I love that the developers went this route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was nothing really new or innovative, but the world itself was ok. I did eventually make it to a big city and saw lots of other players, which made the game feel a bit more alive. Otherwise, while I would run into other players sometimes, the game was isolating as most of the content is instanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is a mix of traditional fantasy and silliness. For example, my character wields a massive sword and now has wings (kinda neat, ngl), but also wears a duck mask. I unironically love this kind of irreverence. Does it ruin immersion? Sure. Does it bother me? Not at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Social Aspect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I play mmorpgs for interesting stores and lore and socializing. I love hanging out in a big city and participating in the general chat. In mobile games this is hard, as the chat is mostly filled with guild and party recruitments and gold-sellers. Dragon Nest2 isn't any different in this regard, sadly. The social bit just wasn't that present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the whole, I think Dragon Nest2 is a fun game. The combat is satisfying, the world is both traditional and silly, and it seems easy enough for a casual player like me to enjoy. What would make this game a regular part of my gaming is more connection to the social side. There are plenty of other games that tick all those same boxes &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; have a thriving social community. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Reviews"></category></entry><entry><title>Dragon Nest2 - Dragon Runes Again</title><link href="/dragon-nest2-dragon-runes-again.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-09T18:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-09T18:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-08-09:/dragon-nest2-dragon-runes-again.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm still banging around on Dragon Nest2.

One part I kinda skipped over in the tutorial was the concept of the "Dragon Rune". These are Tetris-style blocks that you acquire and range in a grid and they boost various stats and attributes.

How did I miss this the first time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often, games throw a huge number of systems at you at from the beginning just to get you acclimated. More often than not, they don't really become useful until much later on and sometimes not even until end game. I assumed that would be the case here, but the Dragon Rune system in Dragon Nest2 is necessary even at level 12.

&lt;h3&gt;Details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm at level 12 or so in Dragon Nest2. The gameplay loop is still generally fun and the story is ok (not great, not terrible). It has autopathing, but not autocombat and just about everything is instanced, just like the original Dragon Nest. The main story requires me to complete a certain instance run and I've failed twice due to running out of time. My time-to-kill (ttk) mobs is just too long. From what I can see, there's no real way to hit the buttons faster, so the only way to progress is to get more power (my Battle Power is ~1550, which I guess is low?). I haven't unlocked item enhancement, so I have to get getter gear....or maybe buy an item in the shop? There look to be enhancement items that would increase my Battle Power, although I'm not sure I can use them if I haven't unlocked enhancements yet. The question is: Can I beat this dungeon (and subsequent ones) &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; having to pay real money? I don't know yet, to be honest, but I intend to find out. So is the game p2w? I say "probably" because if I'm hitting this kind of limit so early it's likely to get worse. I'll certainly find out!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Palia vs Villagers and Heroes</title><link href="/palia-vs-villagers-and-heroes.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-05T11:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-05T11:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-08-05:/palia-vs-villagers-and-heroes.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just a quick post today.

I've been playing the Palia beta and I'm really enjoying the casual life-skilling, including the housing. For those who haven't played it, it's a lifeskilling sim with instanced housing and small server caps. Whether or not it's really an mmmorp is a debate for another time, but the actual gameplay is satisfying. I unlocked planting and added some crops and this is where the comparison to Villagers and Heroes comes in. They both have a similar mechanic in that you plant, water, and wait. The actual gameplay of planting is nearly identical when comparing to V&amp;amp;H on PC, but V&amp;amp;H mobile is much more streamlined. This is true in general for V&amp;amp;H, but it really becomes apparent with planting and livestock. The PC version isn't really that much more cumbersome than PC, but it feels much more so because of how easy it is on mobile. I wish Mad Otter Games gave as much attention to their PC client as their mobile. Cross-play games are still uncommon and good ones even more so. The experience should be the same on both.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Why I Like Certain Games</title><link href="/why-i-like-certain-games.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-04T11:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-04T11:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-08-04:/why-i-like-certain-games.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A shorter post today.

&lt;h3&gt;The Games&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Villagers and Heroes - I just picked this back up. I've always thought it was cute and fun and, most importantly, casual-friendly. For me, the real draw is the "Village" part. The housing and farming and livestock are relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super Spatial - Another casual game, this one has a cute vibe that's appealing. It's just gathering and crafting. Also, it's in portrait mode which is a nice change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ni No Kuni: Cross Worlds - I don't play this one as much, but when I do the art style and visual beauty are the reason. There's controversy over its NFT aspect, but it's not really a problem for casual play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ragnarok Origins - This is also a cute game. The story is interesting and it's an easy game to play. I can pop in, run a quick quest, and pop out. Again, super casual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I definitely have a type when it comes to mobile games: Cute and casual. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>What's in a mobile MMO, anyway?</title><link href="/whats-in-a-mobile-mmo-anyway.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-03T09:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-03T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-08-03:/whats-in-a-mobile-mmo-anyway.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We play them, but why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What's an MMO?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of MMO varies more than one would think. How many players is required for it to be considered "massively multiplayer"? How much instancing is acceptable? Is it an MMO if it doesn't have fishing? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the definition that …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We play them, but why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What's an MMO?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of MMO varies more than one would think. How many players is required for it to be considered "massively multiplayer"? How much instancing is acceptable? Is it an MMO if it doesn't have fishing? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the definition that an MMO is a game with a shared, persistent world that contains unpredictable player interactions (and fishing). Player caps and instancing and all that muddy the waters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ok, but how is a mobile MMO different&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a classic MMO like Everquest. Now consider trying to play it on a 4x8 screen with touch controls. A mobile MMO is a different type of game. It absolutely must have convenience features that are optional at most on desktop games. Zone size has to be considered, for example. In BDO, I can spend ten minutes or more just running from one place to another. That isn't really acceptable gameplay on mobile. It just wastes battery life and isn't fun. If I'm playing WoW, I've probably got at least twenty different abilities to use, with some of them being highly contextual. On a small screen with touch controls, that doesn't work. Think about PSO2...on mobile? Obviously, mobile has different needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Common Patterns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile MMOs tend to have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fewer skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simpler fights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autoplay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smaller zones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These would feel out of place in a desktop game, but they streamline the play for a mobile game and make the best use of the player's time and the battery life. Mobile MMOs are great for a quick ten minutes of play while in line at the bank, not a marathon four-hour raiding session (looking at you, WoW). The game needs a different concept of gameplay to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Socializing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area that could be improved is in the socializing part. I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; hanging out in a main town and just chatting, but that is ...hard on mobile. Typing on mobile isn't great and the small window makes it hard to read, especially if the usual spam content scrolls at light speed. Autoplay is nice here because my character can do its thing while I'm just hanging out and chit-chatting. If any mobile MMO devs are reading, allow players to expand the chatbox over the whole screen (with some transparency) so that they can get more out of the chat function while still seeing the game behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MMO players love to argue about what really makes a game an MMO. I'm not looking to settle that debate, but I did want to share my thoughts on how mobile MMOs are, and must be, different. For me, I love a shared world with random player encounters. I don't necessarily want forced group play (my time is unpredictable), but I love just running into people and co-operating on a simple world task, like a world event. Add in some chat and emoticons, and I'm a life-long player.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Autoplay - Boon or Bane?</title><link href="/autoplay-boon-or-bane.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-02T09:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-02T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-08-02:/autoplay-boon-or-bane.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Autoplay is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; common in mobile mmos. Is it good? Bad? Both?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Definitions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm using "autoplay" to encompass both autopathing (where the game moves you from quest location to quest location) and autocombat (where the game fights your fights for you). They're usually found together, but not always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Debate …&lt;/h3&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Autoplay is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; common in mobile mmos. Is it good? Bad? Both?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Definitions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm using "autoplay" to encompass both autopathing (where the game moves you from quest location to quest location) and autocombat (where the game fights your fights for you). They're usually found together, but not always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Debate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual argument against autoplay is that you're not actually playing a game at that point. You're watching it play itself. If you're just watching, why not watch a movie or something with a better story? And that's a fair point. Are you really "playing" and is it worth your time to watch a game play itself? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr - It depends on the player and the game&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, autopathing on a mobile game is almost a requirement. Touchscreen controls are &lt;em&gt;ok&lt;/em&gt; and navigating to places isn't that engaging. The small screen sometimes makes it hard to even see where the destination is, so having the game walk me to the quest-giver or the next zone is a convenience. Am I missing gameplay? Sure. Am I missing riveting gameplay? No. Holding down W on a pc for 10 minutes isn't super enjoyable, either. That said, I still enjoy games without it. Villagers and Heroes and Toram Online both require the player to handle their own travel and I love those games. Would I love them more if they had autopathing? No, but I wouldn't object to the convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autocombat is a bit more of a mixed bag. Combat in mmos is often the central part of the gameplay loop and games can make it or break it based on the quality of the combat experience. Why play a game where the combat is out of your hands? Have you ever had a fetch quest where you had to kill far more mobs than you thought you would because of RNG? Or some quests that have you kill huge numbers of mobs (I'm looking at you, BDO)? After the first few mobs of quests like these, how much fun is the combat? It usually ends up boring and repetitive. If you're looking for specific types of mobs that are mixed in with others, you end up pathing your character in ways to avoid aggroing the unneeded ones, essentially working to play the game &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt;. Imagine a game where you could fight the first few mobs and enjoy it and have the game complete the rest of them? Take the controls for the interesting boss fight but the let game handle the trash mobs? There are plenty of pc mmos that I would appreciate that feature on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autoplay also allows "second-screening", where the game is doing its thing and you are doing something else. Mobile mmos didn't invent this, but autoplay makes it easier. In WoW, if I was on a gryphon ride, I was probably looking at news. In Runescape, it's common to be doing other things while your character is mining. Those are both forms of autoplay, but don't get the hate that mobile games do. Humans aren't great at multi-tasking, but we still do it; why not play games that allow us to do it better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some extra thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autoplay doesn't make a bad game good. There are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of trash mobile mmos out there and they don't suddenly become good games because of autoplay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I can't turn autoplay off, the game is bad. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autoplay is a boon (for me) because of how mmos are designed. Fetch quests and the like are not fun gameplay loops, but mmo design seems to require them. Autoplay makes them less tedious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like autoplay and find that it makes mobile gaming more enjoyable. Others don't and that's ok, too. Let people play games the way they want.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Super Spatial - Crafting</title><link href="/super-spatial-crafting.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-01T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-01T08:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-08-01:/super-spatial-crafting.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Super Spatial (formerly Dazzle.Rocks) is a cute lifesim.

Aside from the crafting and housing, you can also create and participate in "party islands". These islands have player-created games (eg: mazes) and you compete to complete them. The game is cute and fun and a great way to spend some idle time. On mobile, it plays in portrait mode, which I love. Landscape mode is great for action games, but I like the ease of portrait mode for games that require less intense reaction. I've been following the game's development, although I've just scratched the surface of the game itself. See below for a short video with simple gathering and crafting.&lt;/p&gt;

It still isn't doing anything new or interesting and it's not good enough in terms of story or graphics to make the "just enough" aspects of it worth my time (or anyone's time, for that matter). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of mobile MMOs and more get released every week. They almost always have the same systems and layouts and progression and the only differences are population, pvp, and story. If a publisher is going to release a game that doesn't excel in one of these areas, even if it's leveraging a well-known and loved IP, it's not going to succeed in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The controls are standard touchscreen types, but they feel responsive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game looks good. It's certainly stylized and a bit cartoony, but it seems quite appropriate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bad:
* The localization is not great and many voice lines, both system and NPC, are not in English&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gender-locked classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ok:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new in terms of gameplay.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dragon Nest2 Evolution is &lt;em&gt;ok&lt;/em&gt;. It doesn't do anything new or innovative, but it doesn't do anything badly, either. The story, as near as I could make it, is the standard "save the world from dark forces" trope. I, honestly, enjoy the trope, but it's a new take or anything. All that said, the game is still fun to play and I will keep on exploring. Maybe I will find something new or different that really makes it stand out. Check out the video below for a what a quick solo dungeon run looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

It was (relatively) simple and fun with a bit of an non-serious attitude that was engaging. For those who haven't played it, you are a hero that needs to protect the kingdom from nefarious forces. You are also a villager, where you can ply your lifeskills to the betterment of your village. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic gameplay is quest-based and the standard fetch or kill quests are prevalent. The combat is straightforward, with a small selection of skills to augment the player's auto-attack. Each class has different specialties that change combat in small ways. For example, I am playing a Wizard specializing in Frost. In addition to cold damage, my character can slow and freeze enemies and create an ice shield to reduce incoming damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main quest and storyline are fine, but the village part is what makes this game different. A village is an instanced collection of houses. They can be created by anyone and you can join any village that has room. The layouts are all the same. Within a given village, different upgrades can be acquired by the residents donating resources acquired via gathering. Upgrades include better crafting stations and gathering nodes. Your house in a village can have crops and livestock and, with a recent update, decorations inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can 'rebirth' your hero, which allows you to restart the game with the same character, but includes a bonus on experience gains and talents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game has no auto-play, which is unusual for a mobile game, but very welcome. It supports cross-play, although my personal experience shows the Android client being better-performing than the PC client.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Revisit"></category></entry></feed>
