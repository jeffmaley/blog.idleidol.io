&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Character Creation
This is pretty standard. There aren't a lot of options and no sliders, but it's what I'd expect from a game like this. You don't pick a class, just a body and a name. This game wants to really focus on a community, so you only get one character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classes
Class is determined by your weapon and they've got the standard four (warrior, mage, cleric, ranger). Nothing really special, but the starter weapons are amusing. The mage has a flower as a wand/staff and the cleric has a chunk of wood that he throws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combat
Lots of auto, but you can take manual control. The combat is on par for other mobile titles. Nothing really stands out yet, either good or bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World
This, certainly, is where the devs are trying to make the game shine. It seems to borrow some elements from SAO in that you're constantly trying to progress through dungeon/world levels to find the Big Bad, although that Big Bad hasn't really been defined clearly yet. The level you start on is a bunch of disconnected islands that you sort of get thrown between. It's interesting and fun and I want to see more, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrapping Up
So far, while the game doesn't appear to offer much beyond what other titles have, it has packaged it in a desirable fashion. The art style is cute, the world seems like it will be fun to explore, there's a big of irreverence, and nothing really feels off. One exception to that is the dubious localization, but that's, also, kind of on brand for mobile mmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

The movies were fun and had an engaging take on magic, magic societies, and the rules that bind them. I've played for a grand total of about 20 minutes, so this is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; first look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game is easy to get into and you start by interacting with Hagrid and getting your invite to Hogwarts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The characters are voice-acted and seem pretty good so far&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combat is card-based, but it doesn't feel clunky or awkward (at least not yet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The art is flat and stylized, but feels appropriate for the game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Bad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing yet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Weird&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The character designs have oddly dark knuckles. It makes them look like they've all been in fistfights.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Good:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The controls are standard touchscreen types, but they feel responsive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game looks good. It's certainly stylized and a bit cartoony, but it seems quite appropriate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bad:
* The localization is not great and many voice lines, both system and NPC, are not in English&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gender-locked classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ok:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new in terms of gameplay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dragon Nest2 Evolution is &lt;em&gt;ok&lt;/em&gt;. It doesn't do anything new or innovative, but it doesn't do anything badly, either. The story, as near as I could make it, is the standard "save the world from dark forces" trope. I, honestly, enjoy the trope, but it's a new take or anything. All that said, the game is still fun to play and I will keep on exploring. Maybe I will find something new or different that really makes it stand out. Check out the video below for a what a quick solo dungeon run looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
