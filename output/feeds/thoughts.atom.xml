&lt;h1&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WoW is in the middle of its 20th anniversery event. That's initially what drew me back. I only started playing in 2009 or so, during WotLK, but I've played it on and off since. I've never been much for raiding, although I did enjoy it a bit in both WotLK and Legion. Same for Mythics. I've done them, but they're not my cup of tea. I like collecting things and achievements and leveling alts. WoW is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; alt-friendly so it suits me well in that regard. I love the class distinction in WoW and how classes are more than just a collection of different attacks, but also have unique abilities that aren't combat. Mages have teleports and warlocks have water-breathing. They're fun and neat and really give a specific "feel" to a given class. Combat itself is also enjoyable, with different classes having pretty unique styles and flows, whether it's the cooldown-watching of a Death Knight or the famous three-button rotation of an Arcane Mage. The lore is in-depth with dozens and dozens of books exploring every facet of Azeroth's history, including some really neat takes on creation.
The cartoony-ness can be a turn off, but I find it charming. The usual complaints are about subscription costs and monetization, poor balance, and unimagintive content. There's some truth to those complaints, but as a casual player I've never had any issues. I'm not saying everyone should like WoW; I'm saying that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; like WoW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;New World&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New World is a polar opposite of WoW in that it has action combat and more realistic graphics. It certainly isn't as lore-rich as WoW, but it also doesn't have decades of Warcraft lore to draw from. The story in New World is interesting and very different in setting, even if the over-arching themese are similar. The aesthetic of New World is one of the more compelling aspects as I've not seen it in another MMO. Instead of traditional fantasy elements, the vibe is, well, New World, as in what people and places looked like during the settling of the US by European colonists. This really makes the game stand out from others, although if you're not a big fan of that atmosphere, there aren't really any options to change it. All the looks, even in the store, adhere to the same feel.
New World is classless and abilities are tied to the equipped weapon. Classless mmos aren't new and New World does it very similarly to others (eg: Elder Scrolls Online), but it doesn't have a traditional mage or priest class. There are magic staves and magic gloves that provide mage- and priest-like abilities, but they play very differently. Melee classes are what you'd expect. One odd omission is that there is no dual-wielding. I would love to see Amazon Game Studios add dual-wielding in the future.
Crafting and housing are another area where New World is in sharp contrast to WoW. A given character can do every gathering and crafting profession. The gathering is much more satisfying in New World; you can chop down trees and they actually fall. Housing is instanced, but the instances are entered from the city in which the house exists, so there's still a bit of a local neighborhood feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both games are fun to play and engaging with plenty of activities. It's nice to have another game to switch to when I get burnt out on one, especially since they're so different.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>The End of Blaugust2023</title><link href="/the-end-of-blaugust2023.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-31T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-31T10:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-08-31:/the-end-of-blaugust2023.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, Blaugust2023 is over.

&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've tried, and failed, at blogging so many times, but this time seems different. I've found a topic I'm interested in and one that brings me joy to deep-dive in and explore. I'm focusing less on putting out the One True Post and more on consistency. Just keep writing. Obviously I didn't manage it every day, but I'm happy with every other day. In truth, I see this blog as updating once or twice per week. I'd like to spend more time developing quality posts (but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; perfect) then quick little micro-blogs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, more of this. I'll keep playing existing and trying new mobile mmos. It's a fantastic space full of some of the most garbage games ever made, but also some real gems with heart and depth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play on!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Blogging Is Hard...Kinda</title><link href="/blogging-is-hardkinda.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-22T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-22T10:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-08-22:/blogging-is-hardkinda.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've wanted to write a blog for years.

In fact, I've tried to start one several times and each time I lose interest or life gets busy or I question whether or not I'm offering anything of value and I stop. When I saw the posts about #Blaugust an massivelyop.com, I decided to try again. This time it would be different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it has been. Sort of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The #Blaugust committment was one post per day. I'm not really doing that, but I figured that any number of posts for the month was better than none. I had a topic that I was really interested and passionate about. All I had to do was write. Easy, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yes, but actually, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like writing, but the writing I do for work is all dry and technical. Writing for myself, with own voice, has turned out to be much harder. Looking at what I've posted, I have had a lot of short posts, posts that could have been mastodon toots, to be honest. That's not what I wanted. I &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; lengthy, well-written and designed posts that really communicated my thoughts. Instead, I've done a lot of what is essentially shouting at people on the sidewalk while driving by at 60mph. The mental effort and creative load required for good posts is ....well, it's hard. So have I failed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short answer: no&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long answer: noooooooo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blaugust isn't over and even when it is, I intend to keep this blog up. I probably won't post every day, but I will keep posting and learning to flex my creative writing muscles. It's new, it's different, but I like it and I want to do more of it. Maybe no one reads it, maybe one person reads it. Who knows. I'm going to enjoy putting my thoughts down about a topic that's important to me and that's all that matters.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Everyone Gets a Cozy Lifesim</title><link href="/everyone-gets-a-cozy-lifesim.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-17T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-17T10:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-08-17:/everyone-gets-a-cozy-lifesim.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The recent explosion of released and announced cozy lifesim games has been fun to watch.

I am enjoying Palia (to some degree) and games like Loftia look like they have potential. The classics, like Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon, while single-player, are still charming. Obviously a big shout-out to Animal Crossing: New Horizon is in order. Not entirely single-player and with an unusual sort of multi-player, it seems to be the inspiration for the recent boom. But why, though?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Life is hard sometimes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it's work or school or raising a family or all three, life is hard. It's quite reasonable to want a simpler life with no drama and no stress where you can feel good about yourself because you're &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; things. Cozy lifesims give that feeling of accomplishment through crafting and exploration and NPC relationship building. They're also &lt;em&gt;safe&lt;/em&gt;. No one is really going to get mad at you or cause a bunch of personal drama. In the online games, that may be less true, but the games are still a fantastic escape to simpler times that mostly only exist in Disney Movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ok, but which one is the best?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That largely depends on the style and gameplay you like, but given that this blog is called Mobile MMO Addict, I'm going to suggest an MMO and one that might surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Villagers and Heroes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear me out. In V&amp;amp;H, you have a house that you can decorate, crops you can grow, and livestock you can raise and gain materials from. There is plenty of crafting, including making furniture for your house. There are mounts and pets and, most importantly, &lt;em&gt;villages&lt;/em&gt;. One thing Palia doesn't seem to have is an ability to contribute to the growth of the town (maybe it's unlocked later; I haven't gotten very far). Games like AC:NH have you unlocking items for your island, but that does hit a ceiling. In Villagers and Heroes, the villages are player-created. They do all have the same map, but you can join any village that has space and all the villagers can contribute to the growth of the village and the unlocking of features (mostly through the donation of crafting materials). This simple mechanic enhances the cozy lifesim feel in a way that Palia doesn't. In Palia, I'm a resident, but I live in an instanced plot and my only interaction with the town is relationships and buying stuff. In V&amp;amp;H, I'm &lt;em&gt;invested&lt;/em&gt; in the village because my donated materials help grow it. It's a much different level of personal involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a note to future cozy lifesim MMO devs, consider how V&amp;amp;H provides a great mechanism for players to build their own communities. It's a killer feature that we need more of.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Mobile MMOs and Rewards or Click All The Things</title><link href="/mobile-mmos-and-rewards-or-click-all-the-things.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-15T11:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-15T11:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-08-15:/mobile-mmos-and-rewards-or-click-all-the-things.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Application notifications are a bit of a curse for me.

Mobile MMOs &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to fill nearly the entire screen with notifications and so the first 10-15 minutes of playtime of one of these games is just clearing notifications. Here's how it usually goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click daily login reward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click event notification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click event notification reward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click other event notification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; event notification reward
&lt;edited for sanity&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click for daily gacha tickets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click some other daily reward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally start playing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as this bothers me, I do enjoy receiving rewards, even if they're just for being semi-functional and able to click shiny things on the screen. I would prefer the number of them be less because they're usually just filler stuff and I detest those notifications that &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; be cleared, such as the prompt to make your first purchase. I'm buying anything, I'm not gonna buy anything, so stop pestering me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep the rewards coming, though. I like those.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Dragon Nest2 - P2W?</title><link href="/dragon-nest2-p2w.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-07T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-07T10:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-08-07:/dragon-nest2-p2w.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another short post today.

&lt;p&gt;I'm at level 12 or so in Dragon Nest2. The gameplay loop is still generally fun and the story is ok (not great, not terrible). It has autopathing, but not autocombat and just about everything is instanced, just like the original Dragon Nest. The main story requires me to complete a certain instance run and I've failed twice due to running out of time. My time-to-kill (ttk) mobs is just too long. From what I can see, there's no real way to hit the buttons faster, so the only way to progress is to get more power (my Battle Power is ~1550, which I guess is low?). I haven't unlocked item enhancement, so I have to get getter gear....or maybe buy an item in the shop? There look to be enhancement items that would increase my Battle Power, although I'm not sure I can use them if I haven't unlocked enhancements yet. The question is: Can I beat this dungeon (and subsequent ones) &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; having to pay real money? I don't know yet, to be honest, but I intend to find out. So is the game p2w? I say "probably" because if I'm hitting this kind of limit so early it's likely to get worse. I'll certainly find out!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Palia vs Villagers and Heroes</title><link href="/palia-vs-villagers-and-heroes.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-05T11:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-05T11:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-08-05:/palia-vs-villagers-and-heroes.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just a quick post today.

For those who haven't played it, it's a lifeskilling sim with instanced housing and small server caps. Whether or not it's really an mmmorp is a debate for another time, but the actual gameplay is satisfying. I unlocked planting and added some crops and this is where the comparison to Villagers and Heroes comes in. They both have a similar mechanic in that you plant, water, and wait. The actual gameplay of planting is nearly identical when comparing to V&amp;amp;H on PC, but V&amp;amp;H mobile is much more streamlined. This is true in general for V&amp;amp;H, but it really becomes apparent with planting and livestock. The PC version isn't really that much more cumbersome than PC, but it feels much more so because of how easy it is on mobile. I wish Mad Otter Games gave as much attention to their PC client as their mobile. Cross-play games are still uncommon and good ones even more so. The experience should be the same on both.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Why I Like Certain Games</title><link href="/why-i-like-certain-games.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-04T11:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-04T11:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-08-04:/why-i-like-certain-games.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A shorter post today.

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Villagers and Heroes - I just picked this back up. I've always thought it was cute and fun and, most importantly, casual-friendly. For me, the real draw is the "Village" part. The housing and farming and livestock are relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super Spatial - Another casual game, this one has a cute vibe that's appealing. It's just gathering and crafting. Also, it's in portrait mode which is a nice change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ni No Kuni: Cross Worlds - I don't play this one as much, but when I do the art style and visual beauty are the reason. There's controversy over its NFT aspect, but it's not really a problem for casual play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ragnarok Origins - This is also a cute game. The story is interesting and it's an easy game to play. I can pop in, run a quick quest, and pop out. Again, super casual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I definitely have a type when it comes to mobile games: Cute and casual. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>What's in a mobile MMO, anyway?</title><link href="/whats-in-a-mobile-mmo-anyway.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-03T09:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-03T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-08-03:/whats-in-a-mobile-mmo-anyway.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We play them, but why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What's an MMO?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of MMO varies more than one would think. How many players is required for it to be considered "massively multiplayer"? How much instancing is acceptable? Is it an MMO if it doesn't have fishing? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the definition that …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We play them, but why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What's an MMO?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of MMO varies more than one would think. How many players is required for it to be considered "massively multiplayer"? How much instancing is acceptable? Is it an MMO if it doesn't have fishing? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the definition that an MMO is a game with a shared, persistent world that contains unpredictable player interactions (and fishing). Player caps and instancing and all that muddy the waters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ok, but how is a mobile MMO different&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a classic MMO like Everquest. Now consider trying to play it on a 4x8 screen with touch controls. A mobile MMO is a different type of game. It absolutely must have convenience features that are optional at most on desktop games. Zone size has to be considered, for example. In BDO, I can spend ten minutes or more just running from one place to another. That isn't really acceptable gameplay on mobile. It just wastes battery life and isn't fun. If I'm playing WoW, I've probably got at least twenty different abilities to use, with some of them being highly contextual. On a small screen with touch controls, that doesn't work. Think about PSO2...on mobile? Obviously, mobile has different needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Common Patterns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile MMOs tend to have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fewer skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simpler fights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autoplay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smaller zones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These would feel out of place in a desktop game, but they streamline the play for a mobile game and make the best use of the player's time and the battery life. Mobile MMOs are great for a quick ten minutes of play while in line at the bank, not a marathon four-hour raiding session (looking at you, WoW). The game needs a different concept of gameplay to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Socializing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area that could be improved is in the socializing part. I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; hanging out in a main town and just chatting, but that is ...hard on mobile. Typing on mobile isn't great and the small window makes it hard to read, especially if the usual spam content scrolls at light speed. Autoplay is nice here because my character can do its thing while I'm just hanging out and chit-chatting. If any mobile MMO devs are reading, allow players to expand the chatbox over the whole screen (with some transparency) so that they can get more out of the chat function while still seeing the game behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MMO players love to argue about what really makes a game an MMO. I'm not looking to settle that debate, but I did want to share my thoughts on how mobile MMOs are, and must be, different. For me, I love a shared world with random player encounters. I don't necessarily want forced group play (my time is unpredictable), but I love just running into people and co-operating on a simple world task, like a world event. Add in some chat and emoticons, and I'm a life-long player.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>Autoplay - Boon or Bane?</title><link href="/autoplay-boon-or-bane.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-02T09:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-02T09:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-08-02:/autoplay-boon-or-bane.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Autoplay is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; common in mobile mmos.

&lt;p&gt;I'm using "autoplay" to encompass both autopathing (where the game moves you from quest location to quest location) and autocombat (where the game fights your fights for you). They're usually found together, but not always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Debate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual argument against autoplay is that you're not actually playing a game at that point. You're watching it play itself. If you're just watching, why not watch a movie or something with a better story? And that's a fair point. Are you really "playing" and is it worth your time to watch a game play itself? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr - It depends on the player and the game&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, autopathing on a mobile game is almost a requirement. Touchscreen controls are &lt;em&gt;ok&lt;/em&gt; and navigating to places isn't that engaging. The small screen sometimes makes it hard to even see where the destination is, so having the game walk me to the quest-giver or the next zone is a convenience. Am I missing gameplay? Sure. Am I missing riveting gameplay? No. Holding down W on a pc for 10 minutes isn't super enjoyable, either. That said, I still enjoy games without it. Villagers and Heroes and Toram Online both require the player to handle their own travel and I love those games. Would I love them more if they had autopathing? No, but I wouldn't object to the convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autocombat is a bit more of a mixed bag. Combat in mmos is often the central part of the gameplay loop and games can make it or break it based on the quality of the combat experience. Why play a game where the combat is out of your hands? Have you ever had a fetch quest where you had to kill far more mobs than you thought you would because of RNG? Or some quests that have you kill huge numbers of mobs (I'm looking at you, BDO)? After the first few mobs of quests like these, how much fun is the combat? It usually ends up boring and repetitive. If you're looking for specific types of mobs that are mixed in with others, you end up pathing your character in ways to avoid aggroing the unneeded ones, essentially working to play the game &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt;. Imagine a game where you could fight the first few mobs and enjoy it and have the game complete the rest of them? Take the controls for the interesting boss fight but the let game handle the trash mobs? There are plenty of pc mmos that I would appreciate that feature on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autoplay also allows "second-screening", where the game is doing its thing and you are doing something else. Mobile mmos didn't invent this, but autoplay makes it easier. In WoW, if I was on a gryphon ride, I was probably looking at news. In Runescape, it's common to be doing other things while your character is mining. Those are both forms of autoplay, but don't get the hate that mobile games do. Humans aren't great at multi-tasking, but we still do it; why not play games that allow us to do it better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some extra thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autoplay doesn't make a bad game good. There are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of trash mobile mmos out there and they don't suddenly become good games because of autoplay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I can't turn autoplay off, the game is bad. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autoplay is a boon (for me) because of how mmos are designed. Fetch quests and the like are not fun gameplay loops, but mmo design seems to require them. Autoplay makes them less tedious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like autoplay and find that it makes mobile gaming more enjoyable. Others don't and that's ok, too. Let people play games the way they want.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Thoughts"></category></entry></feed>
