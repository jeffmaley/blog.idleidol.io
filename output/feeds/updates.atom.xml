It wasn't difficult by any means, but it did feel a bit tedious. I'll probably play it a bit more to see if it improves, but so far it's just &lt;em&gt;ok&lt;/em&gt;. It still isn't doing anything new or interesting and it's not good enough in terms of story or graphics to make the "just enough" aspects of it worth my time (or anyone's time, for that matter). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of mobile MMOs and more get released every week. They almost always have the same systems and layouts and progression and the only differences are population, pvp, and story. If a publisher is going to release a game that doesn't excel in one of these areas, even if it's leveraging a well-known and loved IP, it's not going to succeed in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, happy gaming!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Updates"></category></entry></feed>
