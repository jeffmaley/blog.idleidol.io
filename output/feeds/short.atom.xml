In my last post, I explained how not using Dragon Runes had caused a dungeon run to fail. This time, I tried swapping in a different rune and the run failed again. Looking at it more closely, the original rune I had worked well with one of my abilities (light damage), but the one I swapped had no boost to any ability, so the damage increase wasn't helpful. I'm getting more familiar with the system and I'm beginning to see how to make it work. Here's a Youtube video showing a failed run followed by a success.&lt;/p&gt;

One part I kinda skipped over in the tutorial was the concept of the "Dragon Rune". These are Tetris-style blocks that you acquire and range in a grid and they boost various stats and attributes. I only have room for one and adding one of the ones I'd found granted some extra elemental damage to one of the skills. This was enough to tip the scales and I completed the instance. How did I miss this the first time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often, games throw a huge number of systems at you at from the beginning just to get you acclimated. More often than not, they don't really become useful until much later on and sometimes not even until end game. I assumed that would be the case here, but the Dragon Rune system in Dragon Nest2 is necessary even at level 12. I guess the lesson for me is to slow down and pay more attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Short"></category></entry><entry><title>Super Spatial - Crafting</title><link href="/super-spatial-crafting.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-01T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-01T08:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-08-01:/super-spatial-crafting.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Super Spatial (formerly Dazzle.Rocks) is a cute lifesim.

Aside from the crafting and housing, you can also create and participate in "party islands". These islands have player-created games (eg: mazes) and you compete to complete them. The game is cute and fun and a great way to spend some idle time. On mobile, it plays in portrait mode, which I love. Landscape mode is great for action games, but I like the ease of portrait mode for games that require less intense reaction. I've been following the game's development, although I've just scratched the surface of the game itself. See below for a short video with simple gathering and crafting.&lt;/p&gt;
