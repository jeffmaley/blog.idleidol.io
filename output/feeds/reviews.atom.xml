&lt;p&gt;Ragnarok Online has had many incarnations over the years, with several of them on mobile. Ragnarok Origins was published by Gravity Games, but shut down in late 2023. They stated that wanted a global version and that somehow required them to shutdown the existing game, which makes sense, but they oddly couldn't transfer characters, which is weird. In any case, the new version is Ragnarok Origins Global. It's the same game, as far as I can tell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Classes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ragnarok Origins Global (ROO) boasts the same classes as its predessor, including Swordsman, Acolyte, Mage, Apprentice, Thief, and Merchant. These have subclasses as you progress and while the build variety isn't huge, they're still enjoyable enough to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Character Creation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's not much to it, to be honest. There's some variety but, the game is stylized and cartoony and that limits the creativity allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gameplay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROO is quest-heavy with plenty of systems that have their own sidequests. Yes, there are dailies. A lot of the game can be autoplayed, but several of the dailies cannot, which is refreshing. Combat is basic, but ROO keeps true to its lineage with damage number display. Attacks &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; impactful because of the big numbers. The game throws health and mana potions at you and provides a device to automatically use them, so as long as you're not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; ambitious, it's easy to survive. That said, it is possible to bite off more than you can chew, so death certainly happens. There is auto-pathing and plenty of fast travel (Kafra Service), so it's simple to hop between cities and other locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Gacha&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a mobile title, so of course there's gacha. This is primarily in the form of pets. The pets are both collectible and assistants in battle. I'm not sure how much they really help, but they're often cute, so who cares. I'm just glad they're not all waifus. Some of them are, but it's almost a requirement at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROO, like other Ragnarok titles, is set in a realm heavily influenced by Norse Mythology. The world is Midgard and you're The Chosen One^TM^. The story itself starts off with a bit mystery and is rather engaging. It might not be innovative, but that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game appeals to me. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but has a lot of heart and it's cute. I can spend a surprising amount of time in the game without realizing and that's pretty amazing for a mobile title. Sure, the monetization is everywhere, but it's also easy enough to tune out and just experience the journey. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Reviews"></category></entry><entry><title>The Legend of Neverland - A Review</title><link href="/the-legend-of-neverland-a-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-12-14T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-14T10:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-12-14:/the-legend-of-neverland-a-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Legend of Neverland is an open-world mmorpg with a fantasy theme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Classes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Classes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four classes: Swordman, Ranger, Scholar, and Craftsman. I played a Swordman, which is pretty self-explanatory, and the Ranger is straightforward. The Scholar looks like a mage/healer class and the Craftsman is a gunner. Each class also has subclasses and these can provide a bit more depth to otherwise standard gameplay. You can switch classes later in the game and this provides an option to add ranged to melee characters and melee to ranged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Flower Fairies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the gacha component. Flower Fairies are combat assistants and different fairies have different abilities and have different synergies and elemental affinities. Strategies for team formation require an understanding of the specific need for a fight and how the different fairy abilities combine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Story&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the usual chosen-one type story, but it is entertaining and there is decent voice-acting. There are some dramatic moments and the story-telling is better than I expected. I haven't completed the story, but I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Gameplay&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most mobile titles, this game offers a range from no autoplay to complete autoplay. I found that I enjoyed having the game do the actual combat but I handle movement. Responding to telegraphs from boss creatures while letting the game handle which skill to use (entirely based on cd) was fun. In fact, a few of the boss fights were challenging and I had to repeat them. It wasn't just about gear; it was about learning the fight, which is something I rarely see in mobile titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Dailies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there are a lot of dailies. Most of them can auto-played, but as mentioned above, some fights require a human touch. The dailies, if you do the minimum, take about 25 minutes (around level 100); they might take longer later on. If I wanted to do &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the dailies, that's a big chunk of time. They're important for gearing and progression, so you need to do some of them but if you're doing dailies, you're not playing the story and then the game becomes a chore. This problem isn't unique to Legend of Neverland; this is endemic in the mmorpg genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;PVP&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is PVP. So far, I've only seen 1v1 and it's auto-playable. I've only done it as part of dailies. Maybe it gets better later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Cosmetics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a sucker for costumes and there are a lot of options. Too many of them either require real money or are temporory and neither of those really appeal to me. It's a shame, because the costumes I see around look great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Housing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's housing with farming for materials. The housing doesn't appear to have internal decorations, so it's just an outside view. Neat, but not super-engaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy playing it. It's an interesting story, the gameplay is fine, and it's casual. The game also seems populated and even that is a pretty big draw. I'd love more accessible costumes, but I won't hold my breath. I'll probably keep playing it, but I don't think it will become a "main" mobile title for me. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Reviews"></category></entry><entry><title>Divine W Perfect Wonderland - Review</title><link href="/divine-w-perfect-wonderland-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-10-31T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-10-31T10:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-10-31:/divine-w-perfect-wonderland-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Divine W Perfect Wonderland is an open-world mmorpg from Leniu Games.

It is set in a world of Chinese mythology and features a variety of classes. Honestly, I could probably copy and paste the review from Immortal Sword: Return and it would be pretty accurate. There are some class differences: Divine W has more of them and there's no Demon kid class, although there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a dark magic user. There is a heavy amount of auto-play and levels are handed out like candy. I was level 40 after less than 15 minutes of 'playing'. So the question is: Is it fun? For me, yes, yes it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game has fantastic graphics and a rich world full of whimsy (you get a pig companion early on). The characters have great costumes, including wings (I'm a sucker for wings). The story is, honestly, a bit hard to follow, but you might be the partial reincarnation of the 'Great Sage'. This same idea was also in Immortal Sword: Return. Wikipedia (and other sources) suggest that this was another name for Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, a well-known staple of mythology. Why is this important? Because the story of this game ties into some really interesting mythology and a good story (and the accompanying lore) can make a game much more immersive and fun, even if you're mostly reading (and digesting) quest text while the game sort of plays itself. As always, I can take over and manually move and fight and for some boss fights, it's worth doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, should &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; play this game? If you like Chinese mythology, rough-around-the-edges localization, and a very casual gaming experience, absolutely. If none of those appeal to you, the game will not be fun.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Reviews"></category></entry><entry><title>Immortal Sword: Return - A Review</title><link href="/immortal-sword-return-a-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-09-25T18:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-09-25T18:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-09-25:/immortal-sword-return-a-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Immortal Sword: Return is an open-world MMORPG from Jamland International Limited.

&lt;h2&gt;Character Creation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are five character archetypes: Fogbow (swordsman), Luna (swordswoman), Rosy (mage), Nightmare (demon), and Bodhi (monk). Customization is limited, but the characters do feel like they have their own identity in terms of abilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intro Area&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start the game looking for a way to revive your dead companion. This is usually where abilities get taught, but this game relies &lt;em&gt;heavily&lt;/em&gt; on auto-play. The intro area does introduce the story, but the localization made it tough for me to figure out what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gameplay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, you watch your character do stuff. You could take over and play it yourself, but nothing seems really challenging and even the boss fights are over in seconds. My character is level 47; maybe it gets harder later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I have no idea. You end up interacting with various immortals and I think you're supposed to be on the path to becoming an immortal, but it was tough to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been on a quest to find an enjoyable Wuxia game and while this isn't it, it was not necessarily a bad game. I did enjoy following along and trying to figure out the story while the game played itself. There was a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of dialog and that tells me there is some story and lore here even if I was having trouble following it. The character I picked was Nightmare, a little demon kid and I really loved that concept. A kid who turns into a demon for fights; what's not to love about that? It may not be a game for me, but if you like Wuxia and don't mind a rather passive role in your mobile gaming, this title might be worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Reviews"></category></entry><entry><title>Aura Kingdom 2 Evolution</title><link href="/aura-kingdom-2-evolution.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-09-07T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-09-07T10:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:None,2023-09-07:/aura-kingdom-2-evolution.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Aura Kingdom 2 for mobile has been relaunched as Aura Kingdom 2 Evolution (not with NFTs) by X-Legend.

I only played the original version a bit, but this version seems to be largely the same. That said, let's take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Character Creation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four classes:
* Shinobi (dual swords)
* Dragoon (halberd)
* Elementalist (staff and magic)
* Nymph (bow and magic)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the Nymph is gender-locked as female; the others can be male or female. Customization options are limited, but not terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intro Area&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with many mobile titles, you start the game in battle as you're taught the controls. It's simple and effective, although not terribly memorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gameplay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game offers full autoplay, but you can take control and do it all manually. I personally like the auto-pathing, but prefer to do the combat myself. The full-auto is nice for daily tasks that quickly become chores. The combat itself is similar to other titles: there are a handful of skills and a basic attack. The cooldown for the basic attack makes it not terribly useful, as one of the skills will have reset by then. The fights are relatively trivial, at least up through level 26. Oh, yeah, the leveling is gratuitous; I played for maybe an hour and reached level 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Builds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've only scratched the surface really, but there are some decisions to be made on which skills you level up. You can't level them all every time, so you want to pick the ones that you like. I would imagine they're all perfectly viable, but if the end game is competitive your choices might matter more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eidolons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the gacha companions. You have one with you during normal questing and some dungeons will involve a squad of them. They have their own skills and can be leveled up and evolved. You also have an 'affinity' score for each, which you can increase by interacting with them. The interactions so far involved being quizzed by the Eidolon on details about the game or the world and if answer correctly, the affinity score goes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NFTs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this game has NFTs. I guess. I haven't actually seen any and there aren't any in-game mentions of it, at least not so far. I'm not personally bothered by NFTs. I think they're silly, but they're also just another feature and one that I'm comfortable ignoring. Just playing a game with NFTs doesn't turn one into a crypto-bro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit confusing as the localization isn't great. It's a standard chosen-one type thing and you have to collect pieces of something to restore balance or something. It's not impactful, which is a shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a run-of-the-mill mobile game by X-Legend. If you like other X-Legend titles, which I do, this game will provide some enjoyment. If you require in-depth stories and gameplay, this game is probably not for you. In comparison to Dragon Nest 2 Evolution, the combat in Aura Kingdom 2 Evolution is easier and the gameplay is less instanced.  If you like games that are a bit goofy and irreverent, it's worth checking out. Look at my character riding a sheep:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've reached level 16 in Dragon Nest2 and while I will probably play it on and off, I feel that I've played it enough to get a sense for the game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've reached level 16 in Dragon Nest2 and while I will probably play it on and off, I feel that I've played it enough to get a sense for the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is a little confusing, but you're tasked with figuring out the purpose and/or recharding a Sage Stone. This somehow plays into defeating Elena, who appears to be a powerful sorceress. There's likely more to the story that unfolds, but it's very much a standard "Chosen hero defeats the Big Bad". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quests are fetch quests or kill X mobs, at least in the overworld game. Much of the actual gameplay involves instanced dungeons. In those, the quest is just to complete the dungeon. The text localization is ok, but all the voice-acting is non-English. Although simple, the developers did try to insert some emotional content and you end up witnessing the death of an NPC that you couldn't save. That's a nice tough, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gameplay&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combat is the big focus here. While the game has autopathing, it does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have autocombat. The combat is pretty standard, but the need for the basic attack is largely absent as there are plenty of skills with cooldowns that don't overlap. I was using a basic attack only occasionally. In dungeons, this is important because they're timed and you're not making the most efficient use of your abilities, you will run out of time and have to re-run it. There is a dogdge mechanic, but as of level 16 most damage can be tanked. There are some crowd-control effects from some bosses, but even those weren't a big driver for dodge. What &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a driver was an optional passive that increased movement and damage after a successful dodge, at least as a warrior. Area of effect damage is ideal and the warrior has some abilities for this, but getting the mobs to group up was a bit of a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general flow was autopath from one quest-giver to the next, auto-path to the dungeon, clear the dungeon, and rinse and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are upgrade systems in terms of Dragon Runes for the character and their skills and Dragon Jewels for gear. The jewels are the same mechanic as in every other game, but it looks like the Dragon Runes are a bit different. A given rune will boost certain types of damage (like light and water, or darkness and fire), but you can slot multiple runes in a Tetris-like configuration. That is something I haven't seen before and I love that the developers went this route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was nothing really new or innovative, but the world itself was ok. I did eventually make it to a big city and saw lots of other players, which made the game feel a bit more alive. Otherwise, while I would run into other players sometimes, the game was isolating as most of the content is instanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is a mix of traditional fantasy and silliness. For example, my character wields a massive sword and now has wings (kinda neat, ngl), but also wears a duck mask. I unironically love this kind of irreverence. Does it ruin immersion? Sure. Does it bother me? Not at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Social Aspect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I play mmorpgs for interesting stores and lore and socializing. I love hanging out in a big city and participating in the general chat. In mobile games this is hard, as the chat is mostly filled with guild and party recruitments and gold-sellers. Dragon Nest2 isn't any different in this regard, sadly. The social bit just wasn't that present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the whole, I think Dragon Nest2 is a fun game. The combat is satisfying, the world is both traditional and silly, and it seems easy enough for a casual player like me to enjoy. What would make this game a regular part of my gaming is more connection to the social side. There are plenty of other games that tick all those same boxes &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; have a thriving social community. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Reviews"></category></entry></feed>
