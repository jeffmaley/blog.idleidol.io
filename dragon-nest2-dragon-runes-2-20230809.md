I'm still banging around on Dragon Nest2. In my last post, I explained how not using Dragon Runes had caused a dungeon run to fail. This time, I tried swapping in a different rune and the run failed again. Looking at it more closely, the original rune I had worked well with one of my abilities (light damage), but the one I swapped had no boost to any ability, so the damage increase wasn't helpful. I'm getting more familiar with the system and I'm beginning to see how to make it work. Here's a Youtube video showing a failed run followed by a success.
